  <h3>Our Animals World</h3>
  <p>Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms in the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, have myocytes and are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Animals form a single clade.</p>
  <p>Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1.05 million are insects, over 85,000 are molluscs, and around 65,000 are vertebrates. <br> It has been estimated there are as many as 7.77 million animal species on Earth. Animals' body lengths range from 8.5 μm (0.00033 in) to 33.6 m (110 ft). They have complex ecologies and interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The scientific study of animals is known as zoology, and the study of animal behaviors is known as ethology.</p>

  They talk all day
  and when it starts to get dark
  they lower their voices
  to converse with their own shadows
  and with the silence.

  They are like everybody
  —the parakeets—
  all day chatter,
  and at night bad dreams.

  With their gold rings
  on their clever faces,
  brilliant feathers
  and the heart restless
  with speech...

  They are like everybody,
  —the parakeets—
  the ones that talk best
  have separate cages.
